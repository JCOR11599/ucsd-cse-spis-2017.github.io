# Working With Data

In this lab you will 

* TODO: Fill this in


# Step 1: Create a lab09 repo

Go to github.com and create a new repo called spis16-lab09-part1-Name-Name using Method 1. When creating the repo import the starter code from this git repo: https://github.com/ucsd-cse-spis-2016/lab09-startercode.git

Then use `git clone` to clone this into your `~/github` directory.

# Step 2: Work with the file `non_alcoholic_data.py` file

In the starter code, you'll find the file `non_alcoholic_data.py`.   Open this file in IDLE, and run it.

This file loads a variable into memory called `data`.  That `data` variable is list of dictionaries.

If you need a review about Python dictionaries, you can consult the lecture notes from either Phill or Miles, or you can
review this page: [Python: Dictionaries](/topics/python_dictionaries)
