# Your first lab in SPIS

For your first lab, you'll be using the computers in either B230 or B240, the basement of the CSE building.

These computer run the Linux operating system, and you'll log into them with your SPIS ACMS account.

A note about pair programming

Throughout SPIS you will be working closely with a partner.  This is something you will be asked to do repeatedly in your courses at UCSD, as well as in your career.  At first this might be uncomfortable.  You might feel like your partner is holding you back, or like you are holding your partner back.  This is natural--different people work at different speeds, and someone who works a little faster is not "better" or "smarter" than someone who works a little slower.   Even in the face of these differences, we want you to work together.   In particular, it is not OK to abandon your partner and simply work on your own.  If you and your partner both agree, you can do small pieces of the project individually, but you must synch up again regularly, and we discourage this style of work.

If you find that you and your partner work at vastly different speeds or have styles that simply cannot work together, we will reassign you to work with someone else.  However, this should be a last resort.  Remember, in your post-school life you will necessarily have to work with others, and you will not always get to choose who these people are.  Learning to work productively with others (in particular with anyone else, not just people you choose to work with) is difficult, but it is also an essential skill that you cannot be successful without.  

For your project work, you need not work with the same partner you use for labs.  But for at least the first two weeks of lab work, you'll be with your same partner, so you might as well get to know each other!

# A note about assignment deadlines

SPIS will use a series of deadlines to help you stay on track with your work as well as to allow us to keep track of your progress. 

Those deadlines are listed on the [Calendar](/info/calendar/) which is linked to from the navigation links at the top of the SPIS FOCS website (<ucsd-cse-spis-2016.github.io>), as well as from various other places on the website.

Before each of these deadlines, please submit whatever you have completed on that assignment, following the instructions given.  Sometimes this means submission via [Gradescope]({{site.gradescope}}).  Other times, it may mean simply having your latest changes pushed to the appropriate repo on [github.com](https://github.com).

You can also submit earlier if you like. 

However, please know that while we want to encouage you to try to complete assignments by the given deadlines, if you find that you are working at a slower pace, just keep working.  Because SPIS is not graded, it's OK if you don't get everything done, but we'd like you to do as much as you can.   If you aren't finished, submit what you have, but then *keep working on the assignment* as long as it is helping you learn the material.

Periodically, you'll get feedback from your mentors and instructors about your progress on the assignments.     Trying to stay ahead of the deadlines is good practice for the regular quarter, and it will help you get the most out of SPIS.  But the most important thing is to work at the pace at which you will learn the material best.
