# Planning your Project

This lab should be completed during the Open Lab time on Wednesday of Spis Week 4, together with your [New Pair Partner for the Project Phase](/info/pairs/).

In this lab, you'll create a github repo called <br>
`spis16-project-planning-`<em>areaname</em>`-`<em>Name</em>`-`<em>Name</em>. In the `README.md` of that repo,
you'll start writing some plans for your project.

# About the due date of 3pm Wednesday of Week 4

We'd like you to have at least an "initial" version of this by 3pm on the Wednesday of Week 4. 

* But, that doesn't mean it will be a "finished product" at that point that you never come back to.  
* On the contraryYou may well find that we come back to the README.md of this repo again and again throughout the rest
of SPIS.
* It fact, it may well form the basis of activities you do on Thursday and Friday of Week 4, and throughout Week 4.

But for today, at least try to complete all of the steps listed below.


# Goals

This lab has one main goal:

* To help you start the planning process of what you want to do for your SPIS final project

In the case where you have a new pair partner, it also serves as a way for you to get to know each other.

# What you'll be doing

This lab has three steps:

1.  Create a *public* repo (this time, we are going open source) with one of the naming conventions below.  Use just your 
    first names, as they appear in the new pairs list, and with the first names in the order they appear their (alphabetical, i.e. `Alex_Chris`, not `Chris_Alex`.   Capitalize only the names; everything else should be lowercase.

    * For Robotics/Hardware: `spis16-project-planning-robotics-Name-Name`
    * For Data Mining: `spis16-project-planning-datamining-Name-Name`
    * For Web Apps: `spis16-project-planning-webapps-Name-Name`
    
2.  Whoever creates the repo, be sure to add the second pair as a collaborator with Admin access, as explained here.

3.  Edit the README.md file, and into it, put a description of your thoughts about the project you want to undertake.

    *If you don't yet have a clear idea about what that will look like*&mdash;if you are literally thinking "what? We have
    absolutely no idea what what we want to do in this area!?!", *don't worry*.  Part of this exercise is about (a) identifying which pairs are at that stage, and (b) helping them get past it.   So, if that's where you are,
    this lab is the right thing to be working on to get you past that point.   There is more informatio below.
    
4.  Once you have something that feels like a coherent description of where you and your partner are: either a 
    coherent description of your project, OR a description of where you are (perhaps completely "blank" and in need
    of some suggestions or guidance, ask one of the mentors or instructors for your area to take a look at it and
    offer you some feedback.      This step may continue into Thursday if we run out of time for it Wednesday.

    *Mentors/Instructors*: Please create a private feedback repo for this pair (or use the existing one if its an
    already existing pair, and put the feedback in there in writing.  You can and should *also*, if possible,
    offer in-person verbal feedback.  But please also create a feedback repo and put in at least a brief summary
    of your feedback, even if that is just "This plan looks good.  You are off to a good start.  Let the
    mentors and instructors know if you have questions about how to proceed"
