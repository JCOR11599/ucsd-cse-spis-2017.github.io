Please look back at Section 2.3 in the Guttag book about Strings, and then read Chapter 5.
The following quesitons are based on this reading.


<ol>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;">

(10 pts) In Section 2.3, Guttag discusses strings.   He mentions that the `*` operator is *overloaded* in Python.  What does this mean?

</li>


<li markdown="1" >

(10 pts) You can type expressions at the Python Shell Prompt (`>>>`) and see the result of evaluting that expression.  What would be the result of evaluating each of these expressions?      There are two columns of expression results to fill in.

(Suggestion: try to guess each answer without trying it in Python first.  Then, check your answers at the Python prompt before turning this in.  Cross out any answer that you got wrong, and write in the correct answer.)

<style>
table.two_columns { width: 100%;}
table.two_columns * td { width: 48%; }
</style>

<table class="two_columns">
<tr>
<td markdown="1">
```
>>> 'x' * 3

  
>>> 3 + 4


>>> '3' + 4


>>> '33' + "44"


>>> '3' + str(4)


```
</td>
<td markdown="1">
```
>>> len('123' + 10 * 'x')


>>> len('123' * 10  + 'x')


>>> 'UCSD'[-1]


>>> 'UCSD'[2:4]


>>> 'UCSD'[4:8]


```
</td>
</tr>
