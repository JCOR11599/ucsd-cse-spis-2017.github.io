Sections 5.1 and 5.2 covers tuples and lists.  Those are the sections we'd like you to read for this homework assignment.

<ol>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;">
(10 pts) In your own words, how are tuples and lists different? Give an example of something you can do with lists that you can't do with tuples.

</li>





<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;" class="page-break-before">


(10 pts) Find Figure 5.4 Methods associated with lists on page 62. Let L = [1,(1,2),'APS'], e = 1, i = 2, L1 = [4, 'Phill'].
For each method in the list, either write L if it was mutated or write what the method returns. (assume the methods are called in that order so that L may change from one method to another.)

* L.append(e)
* L.count(e)
* L.insert(i,e)
* L.extend(L1)
* L.remove(e)
* L.index(e)
* L.pop(e)
* L.sort() (Why do you think it sorts it the way it does?)
* L.reverse()


</li>


<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;" >

(10 pts) On page 63, Guttag attempts to write a function removeDups(L1,L2) that removes all elements from L1 that are also in L2.
Explain in your own words why this algorithm did not work in the way he intended on the input L1 = [1,2,3,4], L2 = [1,2,5,6].


</li>



<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;" >

(10 pts) After reading Section 5.2.2 List Comprehension, if L was a list containing the ages of all the students at UCSD, how would you create a new list L_young to be a list of ages of all students at UCSD that are younger than 20?

</li>

</ol>
