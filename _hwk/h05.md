So far, the assigned reading in Guttag has included Chapters 1, 2, 3, and sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of Chapter 4.

As for section 4.4, you may either read it, or skip over it.  It covers "global variables", and while the topic is
interesting, you will probably not have an occasion to need these during SPIS.   In fact, we would generally strongly discourage you from using them.   Guttag is correct that they are sometimes just what is needed, but it unlikely that you will encounter one of those situations.  If you think you need one, there is probably a better way to accomplish what you 
are trying to do. 

Sections 4.5 and 4.6 covers modules and files.  Those are the sections we'd like you to read for this homework assignment.
