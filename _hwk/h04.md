One of the really important skills of programmers is the ability to debug code. An essential debugging tool is to visualize what would happen if a piece of code were to actually run on your computer (also known as code tracing). In this homework we will practice the art of tracing code to understand how functions and recursion work, and also hone our debugging skills. 


Please read Chapter 4 in the Guttag textbook, then answer these questions.

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;">

(10 pts) On page 34, Guttag contends that you can solve any problem that is computationally solvable using the programming constructs from Chapters 1-3. List four main reasons for using *functions* in your program. Write your answer based on your entire reading of Chapter 4, rather than the arguments provided by Guttag on page 34 alone.
