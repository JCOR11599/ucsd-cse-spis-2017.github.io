Please read Chapter 4 in the Guttag textbook, then answer these questions.

<ol>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;">

(20 pts) On page 34, Guttag contends that you can solve any problem that is computationally solvable using the programming constructs from Chapters 1-3. List four main reasons for using *functions* in your program. Write your answer based on your entire reading of Chapter 4, rather than the arguments provided by Guttag on page 34 alone.

</li>



<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;">

(20 pts) What is a function specification and why is it used in programming?

</li>


<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:10em;" >

(20 pts) Explain via an example the basic ingredients of a recursive function implementation. Try to use an example that is different from those used in your reading.
</li>


<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;" >

(20 pts) In the implementation of the program given in Figure 4.8 of Guttag, what is the purpose of the helper function <code> isPal() </code>? 

</li>

In the following questions we will practice tracing code to understand how functions. Code tracing is the process of reading a piece of code line by line and visualizing what would happen if it were to actually run on your computer. This is not only a way to test your understanding of programming concepts but also an essential tool for debugging your programs. Trace the code given below and answer the questions that follow.

<pre>
<code> 
    def swap(x, y):
      tmp = x
      x = y
      y = tmp
      print x, y

    a = 3
    b = 4
    print a, b
    swap(a,b)
    print a, b
</code>
</pre>
</li>



<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
 (4 pts) Identify the formal and actual parameters in the above code
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:16em;">
(12 pts) Using diagrams similar to those in Figure 4.4 on page 39 of Guttag, show the state of the runtime stack and the values of the variables `a`,`b`,`x` and `y` when the program execution is at the print statement specified 

<ol>
<li>prior to the call to the swap function</li>
<li>in the body of the swap function </li>
<li>following the call to the swap function</li>
</ol>

</li>


<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:8em;">
(4 pt) What are the values printed to console when the above code is executed? 
</li>



</ol>
