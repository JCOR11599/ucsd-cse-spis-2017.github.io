# Breadth lecture from 08/12

Topic: Pygame with Phill

PyGame is a package for doing game programming in Python.

PyGame works with both Python 2.x and 3.x.  As it turns out, though, one of the better tutorials for PyGame, namely the website [http://programarcadegames.com/](http://programarcadegames.com/) is now using Python 3.x.

So if you plan on experimenting with PyGame, I suggest installing the Python 3.x version that goes with that tutorial.  Don't worry: it is fine to have a version of Python 2.x and Python 3.x side by side on your computer; many people do this all the time.

The installation instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux are on this page (you have to scroll down a bit to get to them.)

* [Page with good installation instructions for PyGame](http://programarcadegames.com/index.php?chapter=foreword&lang=en#section_0)

That site has a .zip file with examples.   I've made those available here as a github repo in case you want to browse the code.  Note that some programs may rely on other files that are in that directory (e.g. specific sound files, images, etc.)
