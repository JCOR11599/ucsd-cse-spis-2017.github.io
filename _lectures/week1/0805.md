# About Breadth/Depth

Each Friday morning (except for week 5), we have a special lecture
section called "breadth/depth".   

For Week 1 only, we have chosen to have all SPIS participants attend both the breadth and depth sessions,
so that in future weeks, you'll have a better idea about which to choose.

In future weeks:

* If you feel that you would benefit from reviewing and going into more
depth about the material from the previous week to solidify your
understanding, choose depth.

* If you are confident in your mastery of the content from the previous
week, and would like to learn about something different, choose the
breadth lecture.
