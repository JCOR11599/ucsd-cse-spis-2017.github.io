Instead of Breadth/Depth this week, we'll have three depth lectures, 
each on one of the three project areas.  Choose the one that you
are most interested in exploring in more depth before you indicate
your project preferences.

* [08/19 Robotics Depth](robotics-depth/)
* [08/19 Webapps Depth](webapps-depth/)
* [08/19 Data Mining Depth](data-mining-depth/)
