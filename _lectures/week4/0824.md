# Strategies

## Strategies to try
* Acknowledge each other's good ideas!
* Empathize- view things from the other person's perspective
* Be patient with your partner
* Confront problems instead of avoiding them
* Share things: time on the keyboard, conversation, food
* Seek outside opinion if you disagree

* Resorting to physical violence
