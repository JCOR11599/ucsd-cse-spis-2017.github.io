topic: "ACMS Account: Creating ~/github"
desc: "Bash shell command intro, and creating your ~/github directory"
---

This brief tutorial has two purposes.

1.  By the time you are finished, you should have a `github` directory immediately under the home directory of your
    SPIS ACMS account, that is a directory called `~/github`
    
2.  By the time you are finished, you'll have learned about a few basic Unix commands, including the ones in the table below.

If *both* you *and* your pair partner are already thoroughly familiar with Unix command basics&mdash;that is, you know how to create
`~/github`, and you are *throughly* familiar with everything in the table below, you can just create ~/mkdir, and skip
the rest of this page. 

But if either or both of you has any doubt, you are strongly encourage to go through this page carefully and slowly,
to learn some of the basics of working with Unix commands at the bash shell.  That is one of the most fundamental skills you'll need
throughout all of the courses that use the ACMS unix accounts during your entire stay at UCSD.

Here is a table of the Unix commands covered in this brief tutorial:

    | Unix Command | Brief explanation                                               |
    |--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `date`       | Show current date and time                                      |
    | `pwd`        | Print working directory                                         |
    | `ls `        | List files                                                      |
    | `mkdir foo`  | Create subdirectory (folder) `foo` in  current directory        |
    | `cd`         | Change directory to home directory (1st option)                 |
    | `cd ~`       | Change directory to home directory (2nd option)                 |
    | `cd foo`     | Change directory to `foo` inside current directory              |
