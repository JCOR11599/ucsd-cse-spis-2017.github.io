What are some good learning strategies that have proven, in multiple studies, to be effective and promoting learning?

Two educational psychologists, Logan Fiorella and Richard Mayer, did a [study of dozens of peer-reviewed scientific studies
of learning](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/psychology/educational-psychology/learning-generative-activity-eight-learning-strategies-promote-understanding?format=HB), and compiled this list of 
eight strategies that have been proven to be effective.   

1.  Learning by *summarizing*: writing a summary, in your own
    words, of what you think are the most important points from the
    material you've just read or heard.
2.  Learning by *mapping*: drawing a "concept map" (a particular
    kind of diagram) showing the relationships between/among key concepts
    from what you've just read or heard.
3.  Learning by *drawing*: drawing a picture (any picture) that helps you organize the information you've just read or heard.
4.  Learning by *imagining*: similar to learning by drawing, but here you just "imagine" the picture in your mind.  (may be used when you don't have drawing materials handy.)
5.  Learning by *self-testing*: taking a quiz about the material
    you've just read or heard; e ither a quiz devised by the instructor,
    of your own making, or from a fellow student.
6.  Learning by *self-explaining*: explaining the concepts to
    yourself out loud just have you've read or heard them.
7.  Learning by *teaching*: explaining the concepts to another
    student just have you've read or heard them.
8.  Learning by *enacting*: acting out the ideas you've just read
    or heard with some kind of movement, skit, or dialogue.
