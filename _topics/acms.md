To access the Linux machines in B230 of the CSE building (the basement lab), you will need to know your SPIS ACMS account and password.

You can lookup your SPIS ACMS account using the [ACMS Account Lookup Tool].  You'll need to now your UCSD PID.

* If you don't know your PID, the instructors can look it up for you.
* But, you really should memorize your PID and/or keep it handy, since you'll need it often during your time as a UCSD student.
