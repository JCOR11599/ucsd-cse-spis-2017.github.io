The following instructions can be used to provide write access to a shared repo.  These instructions are
written using  a private repo as an example, but they work equally well on public repos.

Here's how, described as both a list of steps, and a list of images.

1. Navigate to the repo page, and click on Settings for the repo

1. Select "Collaborators and Teams" from the menu at right

1. On the lower half of the page, in the "Add Collaborator" section, type in each students github id.

    Click the github id when it appears.  BE SURE IT IS ACCURATE.    Otherwise, you'll be sharing your repo with
    some perfect stranger.  That would be very bad.  So don't do that please.
