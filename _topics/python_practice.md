If you want to practice coding in Python, there are a few sites where you can do that

* [Coding Bat](http://codingbat.com/python)
* [Cyber Dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org)

# Coding Bat 

At Coding Bat, [http://codingbat.com/python](http://codingbat.com/python), you can practice coding in both Python in Java.

You are given a series of exercises and some hints for getting the test cases to pass.

# Cyber Dojo

Cyber Dojo, [https://cyber-dojo.org](https://cyber-dojo.org), is a site where you can practice with a number of programming languages including Python.

Most of the Cyber Dojo sessions are set up with generic programming problems, and a "generic" test framework.

The "initial solution" to the problem is actually just some dummy code that has nothing to do with the problem given.  It is just a 
sample of some code written in that language.

## Cyber Dojo Sessions for SPIS

We have set up a few cyber-dojo sessions specially for SPIS where the starter code is a bit closer to the actual solution, 
to give you a head start.    You can enter these sessions by clicking on "Enter a Practice Session" and entering the number of the session.

Here are some sessions for you to explore:
