Many scientific fields have a basic unit of study:
* Biology has the *cell*
* Chemistry has *atoms* and *molecules*

you will work with functions.  (In some contexts, functions are called *methods*, but they are still *functions*).

You are already familiar with functions from Mathematics.  For example, in math class, we write:
