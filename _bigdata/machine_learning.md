<h1> So what is Collaborative Filtering, anyway, other than "just a data mining technique"? </h1>

<p> A recommendation system wherein I collaborate with friends to filter out your online information for pertinent data and then use it to stalk your movements online. JKJKJKJKJKJKJK LMAO!!! </p>

<p> Collaborative Filtering is a recommendation system where I use people with similar interests to recommend some sort of data, like a movie. In this way, the data points in your set "collaborate" to produce some sort of prediction. Suppose I need to recommend you an album to listen to on Spotify: I would go through the other users on Spotify to find one that is similar to you in music tastes. Once I find this person, I can look at music that they listen to that you don't and recommend you those artists.</p>

<p> The following guide will go over some of those oh-so-sweet details on how this process works. </p>
