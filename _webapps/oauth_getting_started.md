This page describes how to deploy the two examples OAuth applications provided for SPIS 2016.

In the exercise below, you'll:

* fork a copy of one or the other of the two sample applications
* set up the Github OAuth Credentials
* configure the env.sh file for running locally
* configure the Heroku config vars for running on Heroku

What you'll have when you are all finished is a working app that authenticates with Github OAuth, running on Flask, either on your local machine,
or on Heroku.

Then, we'll talk about how to integrate OAuth into an application that you may have already started writing.
