# MongoDB

There is a Python module called [Flask-PyMongo](http://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that we can install with `pip install` to make working with MongoDB easier.

To install it on ACMS, use:

```
pip install --user Flask-PyMongo
```

on Windows or Mac, just:

```
pip install Flask-PyMongo
```

You'll also need to make sure that you add these lines to the `requirements.txt` file for any webapp that you want to 
run on Heroku with MongoDB:

```
Flask-PyMongo==0.4.1
pymongo==3.3.0
```
