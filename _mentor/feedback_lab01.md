Please refer to the solutions for solving the empty room and the maze in the git hub repo https://github.com/ucsd-cse-spis-2016/lab01-solutions

For both the empty room and maze copy the student's solution code into the [Picobot simulator](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/) and try to run it.
If the student's solution works then definitely include a comment acknowledging their achievement.
Then go through their code to check for the number of states and number of rules used.
If you find that they are using significantly more states or rules than the reference, include a one or two suggestions on how they might improve their code.

If their code doesn't execute correctly, provide some feedback based on the error messages given by the simulator and ask them to revise and resubmit their code.

You don't have to grade the written part of the lab.
