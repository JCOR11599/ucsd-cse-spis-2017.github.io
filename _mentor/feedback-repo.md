Each SPIS team mentor should create Feedback repos according to the
instructions below.   This involves creating either six or nine repos
(depending on whether your team is four or six people).

Please create:

* An individual feedback repo for each of your team members (4-6 repos)
* A pair feedback repo for each of your pairs (2-3 pairs)

# Instructions for creating feedback repos

The feedback repos should be

* private
* with a README.md
* no .gitignore needed, and no license needed

Apart from the naming convention, this diagram illustrates what it should
look like:
