Go to the ucsd-cse-spis-2016 organization on github.com and navigate to each pair's repo for lab 3. The repo should be named spis16-lab03-Name-Name

Open the lab03.py file on github and provide your feedback by just looking through the student code. Base your feedback on the following observations. You are not required to run the student code in IDLE although feel free to do so if you like

* Check that the student's code has the following structure. 
	* One function to draw each of the letters in their initials. Each function should be named as draw_X()
	* Two functions, each drawing the first and last initial of each student by appropriately calling on the functions that draw individual letters. These functions should be of the form draw_XY()
   If the students have followed the above structure acknowledge the same by saying "Well done on breaking down your code into appropriate functions". If you find that they have written all their code in a single function, mention that a more mdular approach to structuring their code is highly encouraged. 

* Check that each function takes as input the parameters: width and height and that the parameters are used in the code. If this is the case, mention "Good job on customizing the size of your drawings using function parameters" else add an appropriate comment encouraging them to write additional code that customizes the size of their drawings using function parameters.

* Check the code for comments. If there are too few, encourage them to add more comments for readability.

* Check to see if the students have attempted to draw rounded letters instead of block style letters. If so acknowledge their effort in the feedback.

You are not required to check whether the trigonometry in the student code checks outs. Just that the code is readable and well organized. However, if you find that the lab was not completed, please reach out to the pair to find out of what they had difficulty with.
